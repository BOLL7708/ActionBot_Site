            <h1>Questions & Answers</h1>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is it?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Desbot is a bot for <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/" target="_blank">Twitch</a> streamers that can handle chat interactions, rewards and more.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the current status?<br/><strong>A:</strong> It is currently released as an alpha version, this means major breaking changes will still occur, but I try to make those transitions as painless as possible.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> Where can I get it?<br/><strong>A:</strong> Get the latest release over at <a href="./github">Github</a>.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> Where can I talk about it?<br/><strong>A:</strong> There is a an official <a href="./discord" >Discord server</a> and <a href="./reddit">subreddit</a> for that. Both of these places are very quiet still as the project is not mature enough to market it to users yet.</p>
            <p><strong>Q:</strong> Where can I see what is worked on?<br/><strong>A:</strong> There is a public <a href="./trello">Trello workspace</a>, it will be utilized more when this current gargantuan task is complete.</p>

            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>Desbot started out as a project called "Streaming Widget", as it was a single browser source in OBS that could play back audio and show media on screen.</p>
            <p>Over time, the project scope expanded, and it is no longer suitable to be called a widget, so it has now been reborn as a bot. The project is still running as a single browser source but that is also planned to change.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="big box">

            <h1>Current Work</h1>
            <p>Since more than a year back work has been put in to convert the previously hard-coded configs to database-stored entries as well as a browser based editor for all settings.</p>
            <p>This work is nearing completion, with almost full feature retention, but there will need to be some additional systems built out after the initial release, like the dashboard.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="big box">
            <h1>Future Plans</h1>
            <p>There will be a transition from running as a webpage requiring a local webserver with PHP and MySQL to running only in <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.JS</a>, this as a majority of the existing code is the backend that handles all I/O, so it does not need the browser client.</p>
            <p>There will still be one or more components that are loaded as browser sources, but those will be loaded from the Node instance and will only be for presentation; to provide overlay elements, video and audio playback.</p>
            <p>This will include moving away from PHP as the page templating system, before this happens the current code base will be worked into a stable working state though, as it is a quite disruptive update.</p>

            <h1>Brand Explained</h1>
            <p><strong>Name:</strong> Desbot is a mix of despot and robot, it is a satirical reference to an authoritarian ruler with absolute power and control, and a mindless machine with no conscience. And this thing is running and/or ruining your stream.</p>
            <p><strong>Logo:</strong> The crown represents the despot part of desbot, and the head and face is the robot part of desbot.</p>
