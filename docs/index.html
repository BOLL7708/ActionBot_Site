            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>2021: This project was first called <em>Streaming Widget</em>, as it was a simple browser source in OBS that could play back audio and show media on the screen.</p>
            <p>2023: Over time, the scope of the project expanded to such a degree that it was no longer suitable to be called a widget, so it was rebranded as a bot named <em>desbot</em>. It was still running as a single browser source.</p>
            <p>2024: The project was ported from running in the browser to a standalone JavaScript runtime, with this there was another rebranding to <em>ActionBot</em>, to signify this major change of the project structure and functionality.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="big box">
            <h1>Present Form</h1>
            <p>The main features handled by this bot are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can read Twitch chat, uses this for commands, text to speech through <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech">Google</a>, logging and overlays.</li>
                <li>Can handle Twitch rewards, this means create and update rewards, listen to redemptions and trigger things to happen.</li>
                <li>Can manage Twitch roles, title and category, like setting the game category based on currently running game.
                <li>Can post things to <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>, like chat log, redemptions and screenshots.</li>
                <li>Can connect to <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a>, mainly toggle sources and filters and take screenshots.</li>
                <li>Can connect to <a href="https://steampowered.com/">Steam</a> to get currently played game, game meta data and achievements.</li>
                <li>Can connect to VR accessories like <a href="https://github.com/BOLL7708/OpenVR2WS">OpenVR2WS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BOLL7708/OpenVROverlayPipe">OpenVROverlayPipe</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BOLL7708/SuperScreenShotterVR">SuperScreenShotterVR</a>.</li>
                <li>Can connect to a <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/">Philips Hue</a> bridge to control bulbs and sockets.</li>
                <li>Can send key combinations or mouse clicks to arbitrary applications on your system through <a href="https://www.autoitscript.com/">AutoIt</a>.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="big box">
            <h1>Current Work</h1>
            <p>Porting of the bot to run in <a href="https://deno.com/">Deno</a>. This is an ongoing process and it's slowly progressing. It will involve rewriting parts of the core, adopting third party libraries, as well as making new bespoke components like a presenter that will replace the current widget component. Finally, the editor will be remade with <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="big box">
            <h1>Future Plans</h1>
            <p>There will be a transition from running as a webpage requiring a local webserver with PHP and MySQL to running only in <a href="https://deno.com/">Deno</a>, this as a majority of the existing code is the backend that handles all I/O, so it does not need the browser client.</p>
            <p>There will still be one or more components that are loaded as browser sources, but those will be loaded from the Deno instance and will only be for presentation; to provide overlay elements, video and audio playback.</p>
            <p>This will include moving away from PHP as the page templating system, before this happens the current code base will be worked into a stable working state though, as it is a quite disruptive update.</p>

            <h1>Brand Explained</h1>
            <p><strong>Name:</strong> The name ActionBot comes from the main feature of this bot that is to execute configurable actions, which is how the bot affects the world.</p>
            <p><strong>Logo:</strong> The main body represents three layers, from the top:
                <ol>
                    <li>The top layer represents what is shown to viewers, what is broadcast to the world, thus it is the most visible and has an antenna.</li>
                    <li>The middle layer represents the bot logic, the part of the bot that binds everything together and handle all execution, thus it has hands to perform these tasks.</li>
                    <li>The bottom layer represents the services the bot relies on, standing on the shoulders of giants, thus this layer has feet.</li>
                </ol>
                Other interesting aspects of the logo is that the main shape is a pentagon, with the limbs making out a star pattern, with the body being placed in the center. The layers are scaled in accordance to the golden ratio.
