        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Desbot started out as a project called "Streaming Widget", as it was a single browser source in OBS that could play back audio and show media on screen.</p>
        <p>Over time, the project scope expanded, and it is no longer suitable to be called a widget, so it has now been reborn as a bot. The project is still running as a single browser source but that is also planned to change.</p>

        <h2>Current Work</h2>
        <p>Since almost a year back work has been put in to convert the previously hard-coded configs to database-stored entries as well as a browser based editor for all settings.</p>
        <p>This work is nearing completion, with almost full feature retention, but there will need to be some additional systems built out after the initial release, like the dashboard.</p>

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>There will be a transition from running as a webpage requiring a local webserver with PHP and MySQL to running mainly in <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.JS</a>, this as a lot of the code is the backend that handles all communication. There will still be one or more components that are loaded as browser sources, but those will only be for presentation; to provide overlay elements, video and audio playback.</p>
        <p>This transition will also see a move from MySQL as the database to SQLite, this to make this project entirely portable instead of relying on locally installed services. This also includes moving away from PHP as the page templating system and hosting the whole webserver through the same Node.JS instance.</p>
        <p>Before all this happens the bot will be worked into a stable state with all the existing features working in the current database, which is the conversion that is taking place right now, moving from hard-coded configuration files to a full on database-connected editor. One thing at a time though.</p>
