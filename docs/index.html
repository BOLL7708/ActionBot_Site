            <h1>History</h1>
            <p><strong>2021</strong>: This project was first called <em>Streaming Widget</em>, as it was a simple browser source in OBS that could play back audio and show media on the screen.</p>
            <p><strong>2023</strong>: Over time, the scope of the project expanded to such a degree that it was no longer suitable to be called a widget, so it was rebranded as a bot named <em>desbot</em>. It was still running as a single browser source.</p>
            <p><strong>2024</strong>: A decision was made to port the project from running in the browser to a standalone JavaScript runtime, with this there was another rebranding to <em>ActionBot</em>, to signify this major change of the project structure and functionality.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="big box">
            <h1>Present Form</h1>
            <p>The main features handled by this bot are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can read Twitch chat, uses this for commands, text to speech through <a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech">Google</a>, logging and overlays.</li>
                <li>Can handle Twitch rewards, this means create and update rewards, listen to redemptions and trigger things to happen.</li>
                <li>Can manage Twitch roles, title and category, like setting the game category based on currently running game.
                <li>Can post things to <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>, like chat log, redemptions and screenshots.</li>
                <li>Can connect to <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a>, mainly toggle sources and filters and take screenshots.</li>
                <li>Can connect to <a href="https://steampowered.com/">Steam</a> to get currently played game, game meta data and achievements.</li>
                <li>Can connect to VR accessories like <a href="https://github.com/BOLL7708/OpenVR2WS">OpenVR2WS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BOLL7708/OpenVROverlayPipe">OpenVROverlayPipe</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BOLL7708/SuperScreenShotterVR">SuperScreenShotterVR</a>.</li>
                <li>Can connect to a <a href="https://www.philips-hue.com/">Philips Hue</a> bridge to control bulbs and sockets.</li>
                <li>Can send key combinations or mouse clicks to arbitrary applications on your system through <a href="https://www.autoitscript.com/">AutoIt</a>.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="big box">
            <h1>Current Work</h1>
            <p>Porting of the bot to run in <a href="https://deno.com/">Deno</a>.
            <ul>
                <li>The porting has started in earnest, with the decision to go for Deno and Vue as the core runtime and framework for backend and frontend respectively.</li>
                <li>One of the main tasks worked on so far has been to split the old code up between runtime and browser, which before this was one and the same.</li>
                <li>What is going to happen next, is the adoption of third party libraries for API interactions, so I can offload that part of the project maintenance on those libraries.</li>
                <li>When a minimally viable port has been made, probably only with TTS and chat logging, I will try to recreate the editor using <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>.</li>
                <li>Lastly comes the rest of the logic, to get back to feature parity and beyond.</li>

            <h1>Brand Explained</h1>
            <p><strong>Name:</strong> The name ActionBot comes from the main feature of this bot that is to execute configurable actions, which is how the bot affects the world.</p>
            <p><strong>Logo:</strong> The main body consists of a range of components:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><img src="_media/actionbot_top.svg" alt="Logo top layer" class="thumb top"/>The top layer represents what is shown to viewers, the visible surface, what is broadcast to the world, thus it has an antenna.</li>
                <li><img src="_media/actionbot_middle.svg" alt="Logo top layer" class="thumb middle"/>The middle layer represents the bot logic, the part of the bot that binds everything together and handles all execution, thus it has arms and hands.</li>
                <li><img src="_media/actionbot_bottom.svg" alt="Logo top layer" class="thumb bottom"/>The bottom layer represents the external services the bot relies on, standing on the shoulders of giants, thus this layer has legs and feet.</li>
                <li><img src="_media/actionbot_eye.svg" alt="Logo eye element" class="thumb middle">The eye is a mysterious construct that is shared by the three layers. Nobody knows the purpose of it.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Other interesting aspects of the logo is that the main shape is a pentagon, with the limbs and antenna touching the corners of it, approaching a star pattern, with the body being placed in the center. The layer bounding boxes are scaled in accordance to the golden ratio.</p>
